The cashier

A cashier has an infinity of bills of 2, 5 and 10 euros

He has to give an amount of money with the minimum of bills possible.
If he cannot give the exact number of euros, he give coins and not bills.

Write a program that gives the exact number of bills of 2, 5 and 10 euros to minimise the number of bills used to give the money back to the customer.

For example:

12 euros: 1 bill of 10 and 1 bill of 2

f (12) ==> { two: 1, five: 0, ten: 1 }
f (15) ==> { two: 0, five: 1, ten: 1 }
f (21) ==> { two: 3, five: 1, ten: 1 }
